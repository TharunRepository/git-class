        <h3>Chancellor, DSU</h3>
        <p>Join me in taking the first steps as we set up the Dayananda Sagar University (DSU) that is backed by the legacy of Dayananda Sagar Institutions. Our pursuit of excellence in higher education opens up a significant opportunity to the community that we belong to.</p>
        <p>DSU is committed to designing academic programs that reflect present societal needs and those of the future. The education and training at DSU allows a young graduate to be seen as a proficient and confident professional in their chosen domain.</p>
        <p>The journey of the past decades in our campuses is one of great fulfillment, witnessed by the successes that we have achieved; encouraging us to develop a new vision to achieve newer goals in the years to come. Welcome to Dayananda Sagar University and wishing all of you a great future!</p>
